2. Recommendations
1. This application is not mobile first and when run mobile phone, the UI may not look clean
and usage. I would recommend to make it mobile responsible by adding brake points.
2. The application also need little animations to guide users as the navigate through the application
because it offers good user feedback.
3. The application can as well be turned into Progressive Web App by making users work online and next time
when they get internet connectivity they data can be sync on to the server.
